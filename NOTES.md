# Tetrabench Notes

## Append-Only Policy

- Append entries in chronological order with an ISO 8601 timestamp and provenance.
- Do not edit or delete an existing entry after it has informed implementation.
- Append corrections that name the corrected entry.
- Promote durable decisions to [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) without removing the source note.
- Distinguish user contracts, primary-source facts, observations, and inference. Never place secrets here.

## 2026-08-27T18:31:53-07:00: Initial v1 contract

Provenance: user clarification in the planning request for this repository, corroborated where applicable by the primary sources below. The user clarification is authoritative for project scope; source links document upstream interfaces, not completed tetrabench validation.

Recorded contracts:

- Harbor v0.22.0 native ATIF, results, and job artifacts own trace/result semantics; OpenTraces and a custom run database are outside v1.
- Dependencies are exactly `harbor[modal]==0.22.0` and `modal==1.5.4`.
- A deployed Modal Function controller is the detached default. Docker is attached local development/execution only.
- Active, in-progress, durable, semantic, and local-cache authority belong respectively to Modal FunctionCall, a named Modal Volume, S3, Harbor job files, and local receipts.
- Resolved plans use strict canonical JSON under 2 MiB with SHA-256 verification by submitter and controller.
- Submission writes a prepared receipt, uploads the immutable request, spawns the controller, then records its call ID. Missing controller evidence never triggers automatic resubmission because Modal offers no call idempotency key.
- Context v1 includes only explicitly selected files with normalized destinations, modes, digests, sizes, and content-addressed objects.
- S3 records are content-addressed or append-only. Terminal state is determined by enumerating `runs/<run-id>/terminals/<terminal-sha>.json`: zero is incomplete, one is terminal, and many is conflict.
- The controller uses `retries=0`, deterministic child Harbor session names, replay reconciliation, disjoint Volume paths, and explicit commit/reload boundaries.
- Cancellation terminates recorded child sandboxes before cancelling the controller.
- The nested Harbor Modal authentication sentinel workaround remains `unproven` pending a live smoke.
- Deferred work includes Tailscale service access, filesystem profiles/mounts/tmpfs, richer contexts, computer/browser use, VM/desktop images, snapshots, and other detached controllers.

Primary sources consulted:

Planning outcome: the contracts were promoted into decision IDs D-001 through D-022 in [IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md). Only planning phase P0 is complete; all implementation evidence remains `unproven`.

## 2026-08-27T19:45:00-07:00: Review correction to the initial v1 contract

Provenance: user-provided review contracts on 2026-08-27. This entry corrects the initial v1 contract above without altering it. The user contracts are authoritative; implementation mechanisms remain unproven until their evidence rows pass.

Corrections and accepted consequences:

- Canonical JSON means RFC 8785/JCS over strict Pydantic models. Parsing rejects duplicate object keys and unknown fields; serialized plans, requests, events, and terminals contain no floats. Plans are at most 2 MiB. The JCS profile and golden bytes must be frozen before P1 serializer work.
- Content bytes live at `objects/sha256/<digest>` and must hash to the key. Existing same-key bytes require verification; different bytes are corruption and conflict.
- Requests use `runs/<run-id>/requests/<request-sha>.json`. One run ID admits one distinct request digest; only same-request recovery is idempotent.
- Events use `runs/<run-id>/events/<sequence>-<event-sha>.json`. Their sequence is monotonic within an attempt, collisions conflict, and events are diagnostic rather than terminal authority.
- A terminal binds the request and winning attempt to the exact Harbor version, outcome, complete logical artifact inventory, Harbor config/lock/result digests, and evidence/warnings. The controller uploads and HEAD/hash-verifies every content object before writing the terminal last. Failed runs may publish a terminal only after all available evidence is inventoried and published.
- One valid visible terminal is terminal and more than one is conflict. Zero is unknown/nonterminal, not proof of incompletion. Readers retry boundedly and combine S3 observations with Modal call state because Tigris cross-region visibility may lag.
- Receipts have atomically replaced and fsynced `prepared`, `request-published`, and `submitted` phases. Request publication precedes `.spawn`; status can recover the controller call ID from controller records once visible. An unresolved request without controller evidence is never automatically resubmitted.
- Every controller start gets an append-only attempt ID and distinct Harbor jobs directory. Before starting a replay attempt, it reconciles terminal state, terminates surviving prior children, and records abandonment. `retries=0` remains required, but Modal preemption replay is expected.
- Tetrabench provides deterministic Harbor job inputs and tags. Harbor owns session IDs and all task/trial/session/sandbox lifecycle. Child IDs/tags must be observed through supported Harbor extension surfaces. This mechanism is `unproven`, and controller code is blocked until a version-matched contract fixture proves it.
- Cancellation publishes intent first. The controller checks it before child creation and at phase boundaries, stops new children, terminates owned children, and publishes quiescence. The canceller waits boundedly, cancels the controller if needed, then repeatedly sweeps persisted child IDs/tags until none remain or cleanup failure is reported.
- Submitter and controller use separate scoped credentials. Children receive no S3 publication credentials. Buckets are private and encrypted by default, paths and run IDs are validated, v1 has no delete permission, and no secret values belong in configuration or receipts.
- Harbor artifacts may contain workload-emitted secrets. Tetrabench promises only not to deliberately serialize credentials; it preserves native bytes privately. Public sanitization/export remains deferred.
- Immutable context accepts explicit regular files only, rejects links and special files, opens once without following links, compares `fstat` before and after reading, normalizes unique relative POSIX destinations and modes, and verifies content before materialization. Limits are 256 files, 16 MiB per file, and 128 MiB total, configurable only downward.
- Docker remains explicit attached local development execution. Detached Modal remains the default submission path. Tetrabench uses supported Harbor `JobConfig`, environment, plugin, or custom-environment surfaces only after a proven native capability gap.
- The planning files were reviewed but are untracked, so the earlier statement that P0 was complete was incorrect. P0 remains incomplete until a committed planning baseline exists. Checked creation items record reviewed content, not durability.
- The Systems Design and GitHub Workflow task catalogs are empty benchmark categories, not implementation queues.

Unproven evidence after this correction: nested Modal authentication, supported Harbor child observation, live AWS/Tigris object behavior, and detached Modal smoke. The plan records these as U-001, U-004, U-005, and U-008, with child observation blocking controller code.

## 2026-08-27T18:46:37-07:00: Notes-policy and timestamp correction

Provenance: local clock check during the 2026-08-27 review-correction session.

The heading timestamp `2026-08-27T19:45:00-07:00` on the preceding review-correction entry was recorded incorrectly. This entry was appended after it at `2026-08-27T18:46:37-07:00`. File order preserves creation order despite the incorrect earlier timestamp.

The append-only policy is corrected as follows: every entry is immutable immediately after creation, whether or not it has informed implementation. Correct conflicts only by appending another dated, provenanced entry.

## 2026-08-27T18:50:46-07:00: Public P0 planning baseline

Provenance: user-provided public commit URL, corroborated on 2026-08-27 by the public GitHub commit page, `origin/master`, local commit inspection, and validation of the committed planning surfaces.

Commit [`5400d401467d2550334f375f324a212eae946dbf`](https://github.com/Tetraslam/tetrabench/commit/5400d401467d2550334f375f324a212eae946dbf) is the durable P0 planning baseline. It contains `AGENTS.md`, the relative `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` symlink, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `NOTES.md`, and `README.md`. The links and symlink resolve, Markdown structure is present, committed-content whitespace and secret checks passed, and the baseline represents no implementation as complete. P0-06 and E-024 are therefore complete.

Implementation has not started. Serializer code remains blocked until E-013 freezes the RFC 8785/JCS profile and version-matched golden bytes. Controller code remains independently blocked until E-019 proves supported Harbor v0.22.0 child ID/tag observation.

## 2026-08-28T13:45:28-07:00: E-013 JCS dependency

Provenance: PyPI metadata, the Trail of Bits repository, and local Python 3.12 tests. `rfc8785==0.1.4` is the maintained pure-Python RFC 8785 implementation selected for E-013; its repository remained active in August 2026, and the pinned release passed tetrabench's strict golden-byte contract.

## 2026-08-28T13:54:47-07:00: E-019 Harbor child observation

Provenance: version-matched contract fixture and pinned upstream source inspection under `~/.local/share/opencode/tetrabench-research/` using `harbor[modal]==0.22.0` and `modal==1.5.4`.

E-019 passed. Harbor's supported custom-environment import path constructs an `ObservedModalEnvironment` while preserving Harbor's session ID. Its public `start`/`stop` overrides record run/attempt labels and observe the child through public `Sandbox.from_name`; public tag-filtered `Sandbox.list` supports cleanup sweeps. The selected contract rejects sandbox v2 and does not fork `Trial` or depend on Harbor private fields. The persistent fixture is in `proof/`; pinned sources are `harbor-v0.22.0/src/harbor/environments/{factory.py,modal.py}` and `modal-1.5.4/modal/sandbox.py`. This clears the controller design gate. Live nested Modal behavior remains `unproven` and belongs to P4 smoke evidence.
